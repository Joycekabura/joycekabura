# 👋 Hi, I'm Joyce Kabura

🌍 I'm a Geospatial Engineer driven by a passion for **urban planning**, **environmental resilience**, and **making African cities safer and smarter** through technology.

📌 My goal isn't just to make maps — it's to **build meaningful tools** that help people navigate cities, plan better, and prepare for disasters. I use software and code to *automate geospatial work* and solve problems that go beyond traditional GIS platforms like ArcGIS and QGIS.

🧩 I enjoy experimenting with:
- 🌆 Urban hazard mapping (floods, fires, accessibility)
- 🌍 Satellite data for environmental monitoring
- 🛠️ Custom scripts and lightweight apps for spatial analysis

💡 Currently exploring:
- Python for spatial automation
- Backend APIs for mapping data
- Using AI to process and understand spatial patterns

📭 I may not yet be in a formal urban planning role, but my personal projects reflect the kind of work I hope to do — creating solutions that help **cities work better for their people and the planet**.

🤝 I’m open to:
- Collaborations that intersect **urban planning, geospatial tech, and sustainability**
- Projects that help build **climate-aware**, **disaster-resilient** cities
- Opportunities where I can learn while contributing to real-world impact
